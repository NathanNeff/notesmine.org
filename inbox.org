* Bash - Forget History

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/10922/temporarily-suspend-bash-history-on-a-given-shell

#+begin_src bash
unset HISTFILE
set +o history
set -o history
#+end_src



Also, if you put a space before a command it's not recorded in history (for BASH)
But, you must have that option enabled.  See HISTIGNORE here:
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-History-Facilities.html#Bash-History-Facilities
  
** What's up with =set +o= versus =set -o=
=set +o= will /un/ set an option :-/
=set -o= will /set/ an option :-/
  https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html
  
See man pages for set (it's at the bottom)

=man set=

  ls /

* Vim

** Do not prompt to save if buffer was read from STDIN

Quite frequently, I use vim as a substitute for `less` and `more`.

    $ git log | vim -

When I quit vim, I get a prompt that says "No write since last change".

I want to avoid this.

* Searching files from org-mode                           :link:org:org_mode:
[2019-07-29 Mon 23:56]

This stack overflow conversation asks basically what I'm looking for:

A way to search my org-mode files easily and bringing up a helm
interface with the search results.

I'm currently using a helm function to do this, but it's a bit clunky
