  #+begin_src bash
  unset HISTFILE
  set +o history
  set -o history

Quite frequently, I use vim as a substitute for `less` and `more`.

    $ git log | vim -

When I quit vim, I get a prompt that says "No write since last change".

I want to avoid this.

* Searching files from org-mode                           :link:org:org_mode:

This stack overflow conversation asks basically what I'm looking for:

A way to search my org-mode files easily and bringing up a helm
interface with the search results.

I'm currently using a helm function to do this, but it's a bit clunky
